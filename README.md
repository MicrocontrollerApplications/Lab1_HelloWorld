# Lab1 "Hello World"
In this laboratory you will 
- get to know the IDE used within this lecture
- execute, simulate, and debug your code and
- optional: recap basisc of programming in C.

Therefore we will first open this Project in MPLAB, flash the code to our Microcontroller and check what it is doing. Afterwards, we will set our first breakpoints to check if we understand the code.
To get used to the debugging features of MPLAB we will simulate the code within MPLAB and stop the time relevant for execution. And last but not least we will change the code to recap some basics of programming in C.

## Excercise 1 - Get the project and open MPLAB X
In order to get the MPLAB project you will work with today, you need to use git.
You can find a manual for Git [here](https://github.com/MicrocontrollerApplications/Utilities/blob/feature_add_git_doc/git.md).

Afer you successfully cloned the project, it's time to open our IDE - MPLAB X v5.20. Therefore, you simply need to double click the Desktop icon, as shown below.

## Excercise 2 - Open the project
After opening MPLAB you need to open the previously cloned project. Therefore, we need to 
1. **click the "Open Project..."**

1. navigate to the directory we cloned our project to (U:\Microcontroller\Lab1)

1. select our project Lab1_HelloWorld.X and click "Open Project"

1. open main.c

## Excercise 3 - Flash the Microcontroller

## Excercise 4 - Check if you understand the code

## Excercise 5 - Simulate the code and stop execution time

## Excercise 6 - Change the code (optional)
